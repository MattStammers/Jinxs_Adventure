# Pymunk_Platformer - Jinx and Gravity
A fully open-source computer game written in python complete with physics and adventure.

- This is an early project. I have been writing games using the python arcade library with my kids for several months now and they are starting to get better. At the same time I have become increasingly aware that there is a significant lack of work using this particular framework available on github. The plan is to fully open source the code as the game develops so that others can learn as I do.

- If you want to get started with python arcade I recommend you start with the simple platformer tutorial https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/platform_tutorial/index.html and then move onto the pymunk platformer tutorial when you have mastered all the basics and started to create your own enemies and features: https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/pymunk_platformer/index.html. I used the well written pymunk platformer demo as my base script and then started to gradually combine it with elements from the custom platformer games we have been building at home. Python arcade comes with loads of mini examples which you can add to your game: https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/index.html many of which you will find incorporated here. 

- Requirements: The requirements are all contained in the requirements.txt file. At the moment they are very basic but as we start optimising and testing I will add to them. 

- Disclaimer: I cannot currently guarantee that the game will run if you download it. Once it gets to a certain point I will start packaging it and releasing it that way with exectuables but at the moment it is still very much a work in progress.
