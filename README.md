# Pymunk_Platformer - Jinx and Gravity
A fully open-source computer game written in python complete with physics and adventure.

- I have been writing games using the python arcade library with my kids for several months now and they are starting to get better. At the same time I have become increasingly aware that there is a significant lack of work using this particular framework available on github. The plan is to fully open source the code as the game develops so that others can learn as I do.

- This game started out as a little experiment but is gradually morphing into something pretty cool which have had great pleasure building. Hopefully others will get to enjoy it too. 

- If you want to get started with python arcade I recommend you start with the simple platformer tutorial https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/platform_tutorial/index.html and then move onto the pymunk platformer tutorial when you have mastered all the basics and started to create your own enemies and features: https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/pymunk_platformer/index.html. I used the well written pymunk platformer demo as my base script and then started to gradually combine it with elements from the custom platformer games we have been building at home. Python arcade comes with loads of mini examples which you can add to your game: https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/index.html many of which you will find incorporated here. 

- If you want to fork or further develop the code then you can. I have tested it on both Windows 10 and 11 so I know it works on those platforms. 

- If you want to run it just download, unzip the folder and run the .exe in the dist folder. There are 18 levels.
